------------------------------------------
[[ PLAGUES ]]

	- fuckhouse produces different resource than humans
	- you need to amass a specific procession in order to bring sun up above the horizon
	- thunderbolts strike down random places:
		- jungle:
			- fruit trees when hit stop producing fruit
			- goats and savages when hit just die
		- village:
			- any resource hit by a thunderbolt is destroyed
			- when fuckhouse is hit, peons production stops for some time
			- when chapel is hit, you cannot convert your savages into peons
		- pyramids
			- thunderbolt can kill a random offering piece in a procession
	- massive rain makes all peons go slower
	- massive winds break down trees in the jungle and can kill peons/savages/goats
	- earthquake stops everyone in place for a while
	- The plague hits the goats. It's spread so player wants to kill the
	  plagued as fast as he can. Yet he cannot sacrifice them anymore

	ULTIMATE FUCKUP:
	Spanish Conquista starts, the Spaniards ultimately kill everybody.

[SIGNS OF ANGRY GOD]
	- God of War
		- The enemies are armed ( if we implement the risk of hunt )
		- Goats are armed :P
		- Peons comming for savages are slower.

	- Goddess of Fertility
		- The grass gets more and more yellow
		- Water ( if visiable ) gets dirty and muddy
		- Trees are dying
	- God of Sun
		- Sun starts to be red or sick yellow greeninsh
		- Rains starts ( a little bit of wather controll ) 

------------------------------------------
[[ BONUS EVENTS ]]

	- God of War:
		- makes catching savages twice as fast
		- human sacrifices to other gods are twice as powerful
		- Enemies are not trying to run away. They stop when player's
		  peon is near

	- Goddess of Fertility
		- makes fruit grow twice as fast
		- fruit sacrifices to other gods are twice as powerful
		- The dead tree comes back to life
		- Plenty of Goats

	- God of Sun
		- makes catching goats twice as fast
		- goat sacrifices to other gods are twice as powerful
		- goat just goes to the city
		- Conversion is faster

	[NOTE ABOUT THE BONUS]
		It seems that those should follow the general rule that it
does not boost directly the god which provides the calming sacrifice for him.
So there is less chance to hold on the prosperity thanks to snowball effect
		
		On the other hand, the plagues should not hit the resource
that will calm the god that casted it. It can lead to very unfair and quick
loose.

[[ SOME RANDOM NOTES ]]

	[PRIESTS]
	The procession can be lead by the priest that comes from the selected
pyramid. It will take some time for him to get there so it will slow down a
bit the pacing of sending sacrifices. Maybe there should be only two or one
priest?

	[MOVEMENT OF PRAY]
	The savages and goats should stop from time to time, so they look much
more natural;

	[BUSHES]
	Put some bushes that covers the moving goats and people. So they are
harder to click.

	[HUNTING THE PRAY]
	It would be nice to have some net throwing animation.
